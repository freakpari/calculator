In this project, we are going to simulate the performance of a calculator.
Calculation of the result of addition (+), subtraction (-(, multiplication)*), division (/), power (^) should be implemented in this calculator.
Given that the calculator must support parentheses of expressions, with the help of the parentheses stack data structure and
Calculate the priority of expressions.
The priority of expressions is the power of multiplication and division, addition and subtraction. Among these cases, the operation inside the parentheses has higher priority
will have
